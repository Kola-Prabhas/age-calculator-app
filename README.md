  - Any field is empty when the form is submitted
  - The day number is not between 1-31
  - The month number is not between 1-12
  - The year is in the future
  - The date is invalid e.g. 31/04/1991 (there are 30 days in April)

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS 
- Javascript



### What I learned

While building this project the skills that I learned are:

- Working with ***Date*** object in javascript.
- Media queries in css.

Handling Dates in javascipt was a tough task to me, but I managed to get good grasp of ***Date*** object in js.


### Continued development

The areas I want to continue focusing on in  future projects are:

- Media queries in css.
- Writing efficient code in js.

Media Queries are what make a website look attractive in devices with different screen sizes. So, I want to master to provide smooth interface across all devices.

The code I write must be optimal so that websites can load faster and can handle when the load is high. So, javascript is the one which comes into play.

### Useful resources

- [CSS Tricks](https://www.css-tricks.com) - This helped me a lot to write media queries. This is the website I go to whenever I have a doubt about any css concepts.
- [Javascript.info](https://www.javascript.info) - This website is the one I learned javascript form. I can say this is an excellent resource to learn javascript.
